Here is a **design outline** for a chatbot-based leave management web application interface that aligns with the previous discussion:

## Chatbot Leave Application UI/UX Design

### 1. Page Layout

- **Header:**
  - Company logo
  - Navigation: Dashboard | Chatbot | Leave History

- **Main Content:**
  - **Left/Top panel:** Quick stats (Leave Balance: Annual, Sick, Other | Upcoming Leaves)
  - **Central area:** Chatbot interface (main focus)
  - **Right/Bottom panel (optional for desktop):** Quick Actions (Apply Leave, Leave Balance, Status, Upload Doc)

### 2. Chatbot Interface Elements

| Bot: What type of leave? (Options: Annual, Sick, Other)      |
| User: Sick leave                                             |
| Bot: For how many days?                                      |

| Bot: Any documents to upload? [Upload Button]                |
| User: No                                                     |
| Bot: You have 4 days' sick leave left. Confirm submission?    |

|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Status Bar: Last action, notifications]                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
```

- **Input area:** Accepts text and includes:
  - File upload button
  - Suggestion chips (quick replies like “Apply Leave”, “Show balance”)
- **Bot messages:** Dynamic, context-aware, with date pickers or dropdowns as needed.
- **Rich Replies:** Date selection, leave type dropdown, reason autocomplete.

### 3. Mobile Responsive Design

- Single-column layout on mobile.
- Floating chatbot from bottom right.
- Hamburger menu for navigation.
- File/image upload in chat.

### 4. Color Palette & Styling Suggestions

- Calm corporate tones: blues, whites, gentle grays.
- Chat bubbles: Company color for user, neutral for bot.
- Prominent action buttons (Yes/No, Upload).

### 5. Example UI (Figma Description)

- **Chat pane taking center, with rounded corners**
- **User input field** at the bottom
- **Quick action chips** above input
- **Chat messages** alternate left/right for bot/user
- **Light, accessible font**

### 6. Additional UX Touches

- Bot avatar with company branding.
- Status indicators (typing, processing...).
- Toast notifications for leave application decisions.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader labels.

If you would like a **visual mockup (Figma-style)** or a UI diagram, let me know! I can generate a textual wireframe or describe what to share with designers in Figma.
